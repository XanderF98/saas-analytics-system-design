# End-to-End System Design & Delivery: Multitenant SaaS Analytics Platform

## Overview
This repository documents the end-to-end design and delivery plan for a fictional
multitenant SaaS analytics platform intended to support mid-market and enterprise customers.
The goal is to demonstrate how a Technical Program Manager (TPM):

- Partners with engineering on system design
- Drives architectural tradeoff discussions
- Anticipates scaling, security, and reliability challenges
- Plans delivery across multiple teams and phases

This is not a coding project. It reflects real-world TPM artifacts used to align
engineering, product, and leadership teams.

# End-to-End System Design & Delivery: Multitenant SaaS Analytics Platform

## Overview
This repository documents the end-to-end design and delivery plan for a fictional
multitenant SaaS analytics platform intended to support mid-market and enterprise customers.
The goal is to demonstrate how a Technical Program Manager (TPM):

- Partners with engineering on system design
- Drives architectural tradeoff discussions
- Anticipates scaling, security, and reliability challenges
- Plans delivery across multiple teams and phases

This is not a coding project. It reflects real-world TPM artifacts used to align
engineering, product, and leadership teams.

## Audience & Signal
Hiring managers and interviewers can use this to assess how I approach system design and delivery.
The artifacts show that I think in systems, make and document tradeoffs, proactively manage risks,
and sequence delivery to reduce uncertainty while aligning stakeholders.

## How to Navigate
- Start with `docs/system-overview.md`
- Review `docs/architecture-diagram.png` for high-level components
- See `docs/tradeoffs.md` and `docs/non-functional-requirements.md` for decisions and constraints
- Check execution planning in `plan/roadmap.md`, `plan/milestones.md`, and `plan/dependencies.md`

## Why This Matters
Technical Program Managers are expected to anticipate engineering concerns and drive cross-team outcomes without writing all the code. This repo demonstrates that end-to-end capability.
